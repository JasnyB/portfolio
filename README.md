# 🌐 Personal CV & Portfolio Website
This repository contains my personal CV and portfolio website.  
It’s a complete redesign of my old homepage — I wasn’t satisfied with the previous version, so I decided to rebuild everything from scratch with a more **modern, responsive design** and better structure.

---

## ✨ What the site includes
- **Homepage** with hero section, rotating slogans, and contact/social links  
- **About page** with dropdowns for Experience, Education, and Skills  
- **Projects page** showcasing my personal projects (e.g. SQL Football Database, this website)  
- **References page** with contacts and blur-style background  
- **Contact page** with a modern form and Vanta.js background  
- Shared navigation bar across all pages with a modern parallelogram style

---

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies I used / learned
- **HTML5 & semantic structure** – keeping the code clean and accessible  
- **CSS3 (modern layouts)** – Flexbox, Grid, responsive design, shadows, hover effects, variables  
- **JavaScript (vanilla)** – dropdowns, rotating slogans, interactive menus  
- **Vanta.js + Three.js** – animated 3D/interactive hero backgrounds  
- **GitHub Pages** – publishing and maintaining a live website  
- **Design thinking** – iterating from a simple CV to a modern portfolio  
- **Problem-solving** – re-structuring the site when things broke, experimenting with new layouts

## 🎯 Why I built this
I wanted to create a **personal website that reflects me** — clean, modern, and coded by hand.  
The first version of my CV site worked, but I wasn’t satisfied with the look and feel.  
By rebuilding it, I challenged myself to:
- Learn **new CSS/JS techniques**
- Improve **responsiveness and usability**
- Gain experience working with **multiple pages, shared navigation, and assets**
- Showcase not just my experience, but also my growth as a developer
