      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p>My name is <strong>Jasny Tyll Bonness</strong>, and I am a recent graduate in Information Science with a strong
          passion for technology and problem-solving. I am eager to establish myself in the IT industry and look forward to
          combining my academic knowledge with practical experience to create user-friendly and effective solutions.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, lift weights, and work on personal projects.
          This website is one such project, showcasing how I enjoy using technology creatively. I am also developing a
          football database in SQL, which has been a valuable opportunity to experiment with complex data structures.
          For me, this is about more than just writing code—it’s about building something useful, continuously learning,
          and constantly challenging myself.</p>

        <h3>Senior Customer Sales Representative – Hertz Bilutleie</h3>
        <p>At Hertz, I am responsible for customer service, fleet planning and coordination, car rentals, and sales
          of related products and services. I handle daily customer inquiries via phone, email, and in person.</p>

        <p>Part of my role involves assisting customers with technical challenges, including the use of our Self-Service Kiosk.
          I communicate fluently in Norwegian, English, and German, adapting my communication style to suit different customer needs.</p>

        <p>My workday consists of a combination of car rentals, cleaning and preparing vehicles, fleet planning, and vehicle check-in.
          Upon return, I carry out damage inspections and record findings in our systems.</p>

        <p>Every fourth weekend, I have the main responsibility for the entire station, which involves
          managing daily operations and handling any urgent situations. This has given me valuable experience in team leadership,
            task delegation, and decision-making under pressure. I often act as a mentor for new employees and serve as a natural
          point of contact for colleagues and customers when challenges or questions arise.</p>

      <button class="dropdown-btn">Education</button>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <h3>Bachelor’s Degree in Information Science</h3>
        <p>This education provided me with solid competence in information systems, programming, and artificial intelligence
          , with a focus on the interaction between humans and technology. I developed skills in the development and optimization
          of digital solutions, as well as an understanding of how technology can be adapted to different user needs. Through courses in data management,
          I gained experience in collecting, storing, structuring, and analyzing data, as well as practical use of databases in projects.</p>

        <h3>Bachelor’s Degree in German</h3>
        <p>This degree gave me a deeper understanding of the German language, literature, and culture,
          with particular emphasis on both linguistic and cultural nuances. I developed advanced skills in written German,
          as well as the ability to analyze and interpret complex texts. My bachelor’s thesis focused on the
          Hanseatic League and the influence of Low German on the Norwegian language.
          I compared linguistic features between Low German songs and Norwegian.</p>

        <h3>Media and Communication</h3>
        <p>This program introduced me to journalism, photography, video, media production, and web design.
          During my studies, I gained hands-on experience with the entire process from idea development to the final product.
          I produced, among other things, a commercial, short films, a website, and a podcast while studying at Nordahl Grieg Upper Secondary School.
          Through these projects, I developed skills in both technical production and creative storytelling,
          while also learning how to collaborate effectively in teams and work under strict deadlines.</p>
